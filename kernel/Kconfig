config SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC
	int
	prompt "System tick frequency (in ticks/second)"
	default 100
	depends on !NO_ISRS
	help
	This option specifies the frequency of the system clock in Hz.

config SYS_CLOCK_HW_CYCLES_PER_SEC
	int
	#The value is set by each BSP Kconfig file.
	help
	Frequency of the hardware timer used for the system clock
	(in Hz).

config  XIP
	bool
	prompt "Execute in place"
	help
	  This option allows the kernel to operate with its text and read-only
	  sections residing in ROM (or similar read-only memory). Not all BSPs
	  support this option so it must be used with care; you must also
	  supply a linker command file when building your image. Enabling this
	  option increases both the code and data footprint of the image.

config ENHANCED_SECURITY
	bool
	prompt "Enhanced security features"
	default y if ARCH="x86"
	default n
	help
	This option enables all security features supported by TiMo,
	including those that can have a significant impact on system
	footprint or performance; it also prevents the use of certain kernel
	features that have known security risks.

	Users can customize these settings using the CUSTOM_SECURITY option
	in the "Security Options" menu.

config CUSTOM_SECURITY
	bool
	prompt "Customized security"
	default n
	help
	This option allow users to disable enhanced security features they do
	not wish to use or enable the use of features with security exposures.

config STACK_CANARIES
	bool
	prompt "Compiler stack canaries" if CUSTOM_SECURITY
	default n
	help
	This option enables compiler stack canaries support on most functions
	in the kernel. (Kernel functions that reside in LKMs do NOT have
	stack canary support, due to limitations of the LKM technology.)

	If stack canaries are supported by the compiler, it will emit
	extra code that inserts a canary value into the stack frame when
	a function is entered and validates this value upon exit.
	Stack corruption (such as that caused by buffer overflow) results
	in a fatal error condition for the running entity.
	Enabling this option can result in a significant increase
	in footprint and an associated decrease in performance.

	If stack canaries are not supported by the compiler, enabling this
	option has no effect.

config TICKLESS_IDLE
	bool
	prompt "Tickless idle"
	default y
	depends on ADVANCED_POWER_MANAGEMENT && !TICKLESS_IDLE_UNSUPPORTED
	help
	This option suppresses periodic system clock interrupts whenever the
	kernel becomes idle. This permits the system to remain in a power
	saving state for extended periods without having to wake up to
	service each tick as it occurs.

config TICKLESS_IDLE_THRESH
	int
	prompt "Tickless idle threshold"
	default 3
	depends on TICKLESS_IDLE && MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option disables clock interrupt suppression when the kernel idles
	for only a short period of time. It specifies the minimum number of
	ticks that must occur before the next kernel timer expires in order
	for suppression to happen.
