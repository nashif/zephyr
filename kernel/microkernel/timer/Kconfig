config TIMESLICING
	bool
	prompt "Task time slicing"
	default y
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option enables time slicing between tasks of equal priority.

config TIMESLICE_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Time slice size (in ticks)"
	default 0
	depends on TIMESLICING
	help
	This option specifies the maximum amount of time a task can execute
	before other tasks of equal priority are given an opportunity to run.
	A time slice size of zero means "no limit" (i.e. an infinitely large
	time slice).

config  TIMESLICE_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "Time slicing task priority threshold"
	default 0
	depends on TIMESLICING
	help
	This option specifies the task priority level at which time slicing
	takes effect; tasks having a higher priority than this threshold
	are not subject to time slicing. A threshold level of zero means
	that all tasks are potentially subject to time slicing.
