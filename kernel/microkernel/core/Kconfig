config COMMAND_PACKET
	bool
	default y
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option adds the command packet kernel services to the CORE API.

config MICROKERNEL_SERVER_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "Microkernel server fiber (K_swapper) stack size"
	default 1024
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option specifies the size of the stack used by the microkernel
	server fiber, whose entry point is K_swapper().  This must be able
	to handle the deepest call stack for internal handling of microkernel

config MICROKERNEL_SERVER_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "Priority of the kernel service fiber"
	default 0
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	Priority of the microkernel server fiber that performs
	kernel requests and task scheduling assignments.

config PRIORITY_CEILING
	int
	prompt "Maximum priority for priority inheritance algorithm"
	default 0
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	The highest task priority for the mutex priority inheritance
	algorithm.
	A task of low priority holding a mutex will see its priority
	bumped to the priority of a task trying to acquire the mutex.
	This option puts an upper boundary to the priority a task may
	get bumped to.

config COMMAND_STACK_SIZE
	int
	prompt "K_swapper command stack size (in packets)"
	default 64
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option specifies the maximum number of command packets that
	can be queued up for processing by the kernel's K_swapper fiber.

config NUM_COMMAND_PACKETS
	int
	prompt "Number of command packets"
	default 16
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option specifies the number of packets in the command packet pool.
	This pool needs to be large enough to accommodate all in-flight
	asynchronous command requests as well as those internally issued by
	the microkernel server fiber (K_swapper).

config NUM_TIMER_PACKETS
	int
	prompt "Number of timer packets" if !TICKLESS_KERNEL
	default 0 if TICKLESS_KERNEL
	default 10
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option specifies the number of timer packets to create. Each
	explicit and implicit timer usage consumes one timer packet.

config  NUM_TASK_PRIORITIES
	int
	prompt "Number of task priorities"
	default 16
	range 1 256
	depends on MICROKERNEL
	help
	This option specifies the number of task priorities supported by the
	task scheduler. Specifying "N" provides support for task priorities
	ranging from 0 (highest) through N-2; task priority N-1 (lowest) is
	reserved for the kernel's idle task.
