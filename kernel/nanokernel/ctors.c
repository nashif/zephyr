DESCRIPTION
This module provides the C++ style constructor machanism used by various
components to initialize themselves automatically. They do this by including
a tag of the form NANO_INIT_xxx in the declaration of the init function;
these tags are defined in nanokernel.h. The _xxx portion of the tag indicates
the priority of the associated constructor, allowing them to execute in a
deterministic order.

The _Ctors() routine is called from a BSP's _Cstart() routine after hardware
initialization has completed.

Although ctors are traditionally a C++ feature, normal C code can use them too.
No destructor support (dtors) is provided.

 * Generated by the linker script, and ordered from highest numbered priority
 * ("do last") to lowest numbered priority ("do first"). List element 0 is the
