config PRINTK
	bool
	prompt "Send printk() to console"
	default y
	help
	This option directs printk() debugging output to the supported
	console device (UART), rather than suppressing the generation
	of printk() output entirely. Output is sent immediately, without
	any mutual exclusion or	buffering.
