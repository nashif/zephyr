Description:

This test verifies that the nanokernel CPU and context APIs operate as expected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building and Running Project:

This nanokernel project outputs to the console.  It can be built and executed
on QEMU as follows:

    make pristine
    make nanokernel.qemu
