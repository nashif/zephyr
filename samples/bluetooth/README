Bluetooth subsystem

= Building =

Build samples

$ make -C samples/bluetooth/<app>

= Testing =

Host Bluetooth controler is connected to the second qemu serial line
through a UNIX socket (qemu option -serial unix:/tmp/bt-server-bredr).

On the host side BlueZ allows to "connect" Bluetooth controller through
a so-called user channel. Use the btproxy tool for that:

$ sudo tools/btproxy -u
Listening on /tmp/bt-server-bredr

Now qemu can connect serial line to the 'bt-server-bredr' UNIX socket
with following command:

$ make qemu

Extra parameter to qemu might be added through QEMU_EXTRA_FLAGS.

There is smoke test application in nanokernel and microkernel test
directories which gets run in sanity check script:

$ scripts/sanity_chk/sanity_chk -T gcc [-B <BSP>]

For quick regression test use bt_regression, it only check Bluetooth test

$ samples/bluetooth/bt_regression.sh
