Bluetooth subsystem

Build samples

$ make -C samples/bluetooth/<app>

= Bluetooth Sample application =

Host Bluetooth controller is connected to the second qemu serial line
through a UNIX socket (qemu option -serial unix:/tmp/bt-server-bredr).
This option is already added to qemu through QEMU_EXTRA_FLAGS in Makefile.

On the host side BlueZ allows to "connect" Bluetooth controller through
a so-called user channel. Use the btproxy tool for that:

$ sudo tools/btproxy -u
Listening on /tmp/bt-server-bredr

Note that before calling btproxy make sure that Bluetooth controller is down.

Now running qemu result connecting second serial line to 'bt-server-bredr'
UNIX socket. When Bluetooth (CONFIG_BLUETOOTH) and Bluetooth HCI UART driver
(CONFIG_BLUETOOTH_H4) are enabled, Bluetooth driver registers to the system.
From now on Bluetooth might be used by the application. To run application in
the qemu run:

$ make qemu

== Bluetooth IPSP application ==

To test IPSP please take a look at samples/net/README, in addition to running
echo-client it is necessary to enable 6LowPAN module in Linux with the
following commands:

$ modprobe bluetooth_6lowpan
$ echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/6lowpan_enable

Then to connect:

echo "connect <bdaddr> <type>" > /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/6lowpan_control

Once connected a dedicated interface will be created, usually bt0, which can
then be used as following:

$ echo-client -i bt0 <ip>

= Bluetooth sanity check =

There is smoke test application in nanokernel and microkernel test
directories which gets run in sanity check script:

$ scripts/sanity_chk/sanity_chk [-P <platform>]

For quick regression test use bt_regression, it only check Bluetooth test

$ samples/bluetooth/bt_regression.sh
