Title: Hello

Description:

A simple application that demonstates basic sanity of the VxMicro microkernel.
Two tasks (A and B) take turns printing a greeting message to the console,
and use sleep requests and semaphores to control the rate at which messages
are generated. This demonstrates that microkernel scheduling, communication,
and timing are operating correctly.
