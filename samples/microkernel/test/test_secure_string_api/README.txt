--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building and Running Project:

This microkernel project outputs to the console.  It can be built and executed
on QEMU as follows:

    make pristine
    make microkernel.qemu

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample Output:

**** Invalid string operation! ****
Current context ID = 0x0010583c
Faulting instruction address = 0xdeaddead
Fatal task error! Aborting task.
**** Invalid string operation! ****
Current context ID = 0x0010563c
Faulting instruction address = 0xdeaddead
Fatal task error! Aborting task.

after calling memcpy_s with incorrect parameters
As expected, test task 2 did not continue operating
after calling strcpy_s with incorrect parameters
