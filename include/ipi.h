 *	       finishes. If there is deferred processing on the remote side,
 *	       or you would like to queue outgoing messages and wait on an
 *	       event/semaphore, you can implement that in a high-level driver
 * @param id Message identifier. Values are constrained by
 *	     ipi_max_data_size_get() since many platforms only allow for a
 *	     subset of bits in a 32-bit register to store the ID.
 * @param data Pointer to data to send in the message
 * @param size size of the data pointed to
 *
 * There are constraints on how much data can be sent or the maximum value
 * of id, use the ipi_max_data_size_get() and ipi_max_id_val_get() functions
 * to determine these.
 *
 * The size parameter is only used on the sending side to know how much data
 * to put in the message registers, it is not passed along to the receiving
 * side. How much data to read back should be dictated by the upper-level
 * protocol.
 *
 * @return -EBUSY if the remote hasn't yet read the last data sent
 *	   -EMSGSIZE If the supplied data size is unsupported by the driver
 *	   -EINVAL   Bad parameter, such as a too-large id value, or
 *		     the device isn't an outbound IPI channel
