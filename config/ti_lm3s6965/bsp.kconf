# This BSP-specific file must do the following:
#
# 1) Source the configuration fragment for the ARM CPU it uses.
# 2) Define any configuration options that are unique to this BSP. At a minimum,
#    a hidden option of the form BSP_<name> must be defined.
# 3) Select any generic ARM architecture configuration options that apply
#    to this BSP, if they are not selected by default.
# 4) Provide a default value for any generic ARM architecture
#    configuration options that apply to this BSP, if no generic default value
#    is defined or if the generic default value is not appropriate.
