# DESCRIPTION
# File defines:
# iHOS_getprogpath - function that returns a full program path
# iSIM_SERIAL_DEVICE - device driver used for the host communication
# vSIM_HS_PORT - serial device or pseudo-device used
#      for the host communication

# The executables are expected to reside in either "C:\Program Files\"
# or "C:\Program Files (x86)".  These are shortened to "C:\Progra~1\"
# and "C:\Progra~2\" respectively.

iPF2_BIN = $(subst \,/,$(wildcard ${iPF2}/$(1)))
iPF3_BIN = $(subst \,/,$(wildcard ${iPF3}/$(1)))

# if a program resides either in "C:\Program Files\" or "C:\Program Files (x86)",
# return it's full path
