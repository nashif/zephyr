# Define empty rules for the files "defs.*" and "rules.*".  This is done to
# resolve a clash between file names (such as "defs.qemu" and "rules.qemu")
# and rules (such as "%.qemu").  Without these two empty rules, "make" would
# try to rebuild those build files when it encounters rules of the same name.
