config	ASSERT
	bool
	prompt "Enable __ASSERT() macro"
	default n
	help
	  This enables the __ASSERT() macro in the kernel code. If an assertion
	  fails, the calling thread is put on an infinite tight loop. Since
	  enabling this adds a significant footprint, it should only be enabled
	  in a non-production system.

config	ASSERT_LEVEL
	int
	prompt "__ASSERT() level"
	default 1
	depends on ASSERT
	help
	  This option specifies the assertion level used by the __ASSERT()
	  macro. It can be set to one of three possible values:

	  Level 0: off
	  Level 1: on + warning in every file that includes __assert.h
	  Level 2: on + no warning

config	TASK_DEBUG
	bool
	prompt "Task debugging [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	help
	  This option allows execution of all tasks (with the exception of
	  essential system tasks) to be suspended so that debugging operations
	  can be performed.

config	GDB_INFO
	bool
	prompt "OS-aware debugging with GDB [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	select CONTEXT_MONITOR
	help
	  This option enables the kernel to support OS-aware debugging
	  using GDB by collecting additional information required by the
	  debugger. System behavior during interrupts, exceptions, and
	  context switches may be impacted by the collection of this data.
