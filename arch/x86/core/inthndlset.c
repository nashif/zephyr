/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This module contains the _irq_handler_set() API. This routine is closely
 * associated with irq_connect(), and any changes to the layout of the
 * constructed interrupt stub must be reflected in both places.
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * This routine is defined here, rather than in intconnect.c, so that it can be
 * omitted from a system image if it isn't required.

/* the _idt_base_address symbol is generated via a linker script */

/*
 * The FIRST_OPT_OPCODE_OFF macro defines the offset of the first optional
 * opcode in an interrupt stub.  Given that only the "call _IntEnt" is
 * mandatory, the subsequent instruction at offset 5 is "optional".

/**
 * @internal
 *
 * @brief Set the handler in an already connected stub
 *
 * This routine is used to modify an already fully constructed interrupt stub
 * to specify a new <routine> and/or <parameter>.
 *
 * WARNINGS:
 *
 * A fully constructed interrupt stub is generated via irq_connect(), i.e.
 * the _irq_handler_set() function must only be called after invoking
 * irq_connect().
 *
 * The caller must ensure that the associated interrupt does not occur while
 * this routine is executing, otherwise race conditions may arise that could
 * cause the interrupt stub to invoke the handler using an incorrect routine
 * and/or parameter. If possible, silence the source of the associated interrupt
 * only, rather than locking out all interrupts.
 *
 * @return N/A
 *
