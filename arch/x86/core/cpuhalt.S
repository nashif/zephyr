DESCRIPTION
This module provides an implementation of the architecture-specific
nano_cpu_idle() primitive required by the nanokernel idle loop component.
It can be called within an implementation of _sys_power_save_idle(),
which is provided for the microkernel by the platform.

The module also provides an implementation of nano_cpu_atomic_idle(), which
atomically re-enables interrupts and enters low power mode.

INTERNAL
These implementations of nano_cpu_idle() and nano_cpu_atomic_idle() could be used
when operating as a Hypervisor guest.  More specifically, the Hypervisor
supports the execution of the 'hlt' instruction from a guest (results in a
VM exit), and more importantly, the Hypervisor will respect the
single instruction delay slot after the 'sti' instruction as required
by nano_cpu_atomic_idle().

/**
 *
 * @brief Atomically re-enable interrupts and enter low power mode
 *
 * This function is utilized by the nanokernel object "wait" APIs for tasks,
 * e.g. nano_task_lifo_get_wait(), nano_task_sem_take_wait(),
 * nano_task_stack_pop_wait(), and nano_task_fifo_get_wait().
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * The requirements for nano_cpu_atomic_idle() are as follows:
 * 1) The enablement of interrupts and entering a low-power mode needs to be
 *    atomic, i.e. there should be no period of time where interrupts are
 *    enabled before the processor enters a low-power mode.  See the comments
 *    in nano_task_lifo_get_wait(), for example, of the race condition that occurs
 *    if this requirement is not met.
 *
 * 2) After waking up from the low-power mode, the interrupt lockout state
 *    must be restored as indicated in the 'imask' input parameter.
 *
 * @return N/A
 *
 * C function prototype:
 *
 * void nano_cpu_atomic_idle (unsigned int imask);
