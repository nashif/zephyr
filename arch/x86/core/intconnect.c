/**
 * @file
 * @brief Interrupt management support for IA-32 arch
 *
 * This module provides routines to manage asynchronous interrupts
 * on the IA-32 architecture.
 *
 * This module provides the public routine irq_connect(), the private
 * routine _IntVecSet(), and the support routines _IntVecAlloc(),
 * _IntVecMarkAllocated() and _IntVecMarkFree().
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * The _idt_base_address symbol is used to determine the base address of the IDT.
 * (It is generated by the linker script, and doesn't correspond to an actual
 * global variable.)
 *
 * Dynamic interrupts are handled by a set of dynamic interrupt stubs defined
 * in intstub.S. Each one pushes a "stub id" onto the stack and calls
 * common_dynamic_handler, which uses the stub id to pull the details
 * about what to do with the dynamic IRQ out of the dyn_irq_list array.
 * This array is populated by calls to irq_connect(), which also installs
 * the associated dynamic stub in the IDT.

 *
 * @param irq virtualized IRQ to connect to
 * @param priority requested priority of interrupt
 * @param routine the C interrupt handler
 * @param parameter parameter passed to C routine
 * @param flags IRQ flags
 *
 * This routine connects an interrupt service routine (ISR) coded in C to
 * the specified hardware <irq>.  An interrupt vector will be allocated to
 * satisfy the specified <priority>.  If the interrupt service routine is being
 * connected to a software generated interrupt, then <irq> must be set to
 * NANO_SOFT_IRQ.
 *
 * The specified <irq> represents a virtualized IRQ, i.e. it does not
 * necessarily represent a specific IRQ line on a given interrupt controller
 * device.  The platform presents a virtualized set of IRQs from 0 to N, where
 * N is the total number of IRQs supported by all the interrupt controller
 * devices on the board.  See the platform's documentation for the mapping of
 * virtualized IRQ to physical IRQ.
 *
 * When the device asserts an interrupt on the specified <irq>, a switch to
 * the interrupt stack is performed (if not already executing on the interrupt
 * stack), followed by saving the integer (i.e. non-floating point) thread of
 * the currently executing task, fiber, or ISR.  The ISR specified by <routine>
 * will then be invoked with the single <parameter>.  When the ISR returns, a
 * context switch may occur.
 *
 * On some platforms <flags> parameter needs to be specified to indicate if
 * the irq is triggered by low or high level or by rising or falling edge.
 *
 * The routine searches for the first available element in the dynamic_stubs
 * array and uses it for the stub.

 * WARNINGS
 * This routine does not perform range checking on the requested <priority>
 * and thus, depending on the underlying interrupt controller, may result
 * in the assignment of an interrupt vector located in the reserved range of
 * the processor.

 * For debug kernels, this routine shall return -1 when there are no
 * vectors remaining in the specified <priority> level.

 * level is determined by the vector number; the higher the vector number, the
 * higher the priority within that priority level.
 *
 * It is also assumed that the interrupt controllers are capable of managing
 * interrupt requests on a per-vector level as opposed to a per-priority level.
 * For example, the local APIC on Pentium4 and later processors, the in-service
 * register (ISR) and the interrupt request register (IRR) are 256 bits wide.
