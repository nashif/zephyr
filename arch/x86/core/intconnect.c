DESCRIPTION
This module provides routines to manage asynchronous interrupts
on the IA-32 architecture.

This module provides the public routine irq_connect(), the private
routine _IntVecSet(), and the support routines _IntVecAlloc(),
_IntVecMarkAllocated() and _IntVecMarkFree().

INTERNAL
The _idt_base_address symbol is used to determine the base address of the IDT.
(It is generated by the linker script, and doesn't correspond to an actual
global variable.)

Interrupts are handled by an "interrupt stub" whose code is generated by the
system itself.  The stub performs various actions before and after invoking
the application (or operating system) specific interrupt handler; for example,
a thread context save is performed prior to invoking the interrupt handler.

The IA-32 code that makes up a "full" interrupt stub is shown below.  A full
interrupt stub is one that is associated with an interrupt vector that requires
a "beginning of interrupt" (BOI) callout and an "end of interrupt" (EOI) callout
(both of which require a parameter).

NOTE: Be sure to update the arch specific definition of the _INT_STUB_SIZE macro
to reflect the maximum potential size of the interrupt stub (as shown above).
The _INT_STUB_SIZE macro is defined in include/nanokernel/x86/arch.h.

/**
 *
 * @brief Connect a C routine to a hardware interrupt
 *
 * This routine connects an interrupt service routine (ISR) coded in C to
 * the specified hardware <irq>.  An interrupt vector will be allocated to
 * satisfy the specified <priority>.  If the interrupt service routine is being
 * connected to a software generated interrupt, then <irq> must be set to
 * NANO_SOFT_IRQ.
 *
 * The specified <irq> represents a virtualized IRQ, i.e. it does not
 * necessarily represent a specific IRQ line on a given interrupt controller
 * device.  The platform presents a virtualized set of IRQs from 0 to N, where
 * N is the total number of IRQs supported by all the interrupt controller
 * devices on the board.  See the platform's documentation for the mapping of
 * virtualized IRQ to physical IRQ.
 *
 * When the device asserts an interrupt on the specified <irq>, a switch to
 * the interrupt stack is performed (if not already executing on the interrupt
 * stack), followed by saving the integer (i.e. non-floating point) thread of
 * the currently executing task, fiber, or ISR.  The ISR specified by <routine>
 * will then be invoked with the single <parameter>.  When the ISR returns, a
 * context switch may occur.
 *
 * The routine searches for the first available element in the synamic_stubs
 * array and uses it for the stub.
 *
 * @return the allocated interrupt vector
 *
 * WARNINGS
 * Some boards utilize interrupt controllers where the interrupt vector
 * cannot be programmed on an IRQ basis; as a result, the vector assigned
 * to the <irq> during interrupt controller initialization will be returned.
 * In these cases, the requested <priority> is not honoured since the interrupt
 * prioritization is fixed by the interrupt controller (e.g. IRQ0 will always
 * be the highest priority interrupt regardless of what interrupt vector
 * was assigned to IRQ0).
 *
 * This routine does not perform range checking on the requested <priority>
 * and thus, depending on the underlying interrupt controller, may result
 * in the assignment of an interrupt vector located in the reserved range of
 * the processor.
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * For debug kernels, this routine shall return -1 when there are no
 * vectors remaining in the specified <priority> level.
