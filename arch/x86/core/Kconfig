menu "x86 Core Options"

config NESTED_INTERRUPTS
	bool
	prompt "Enable nested interrupts"
	default y
	help
	This option enables support for nested interrupts.

config EXCEPTION_DEBUG
	bool
	prompt "Unhandled exception debugging"
	default y
	depends on PRINTK
	help
	Install handlers for various CPU exception/trap vectors to
	make debugging them easier, at a small expense in code size.
	This prints out the specific exception vector and any associated
	error codes.

menu "Memory Layout Options"

config IDT_NUM_VECTORS
	int
	prompt "Number of IDT vectors"
	default 256
	range 32 256
	help
	This option specifies the number of interrupt vector entries in the
	Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT). By default all 256 vectors are
	supported in an IDT requiring 2048 bytes of memory.

config PHYS_LOAD_ADDR
	hex "Physical load address"
	# Default value must be supplied by platform
	help
	This option specifies the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

config PHYS_RAM_ADDR
        hex "Physical RAM address"
	# Default value must be supplied by platform
        help
        This option specifies the physical RAM address of the selected SoC.

config RAM_SIZE
	int "Amount of RAM given to the kernel (in kB)"
	help
	This option specifies the amount of RAM given to the kernel. It must
	not exceed the amount available on the target.  When running an XIP
	kernel, it must be large enough to contain the data, bss and noinit
	sections.  When not running an XIP kernel, it must be large enough to
	contain the full image.

	The default value is specified by the platform.

config ROM_SIZE
	int "Amount of ROM given to the kernel (in kB)" if XIP
	help
	This option specifies the amount of ROM given to the kernel. It must
	not exceed the amount available on the target.  It must also be large
	enough to contain the full image.

	The default value is specified by the platform.
