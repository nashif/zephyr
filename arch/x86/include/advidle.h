DESCRIPTION
This header file specifies the custom advanced idle management interface.
All of the APIs declared here must be supplied by the custom advanced idle
management system, namely the _AdvIdleCheckSleep(), _AdvIdleFunc()
and _AdvIdleStart() functions.

 * kernel operation at the point it went to sleep; in the latter case, control
 * passes to the _AdvIdleFunc() that put the system to sleep, which then

 * returns immediately without sleeping.
