/**
 *
 * @brief Intialize a new thread from its stack space
 *
 * The control structure (TCS) is put at the lower address of the stack. An
 * initial context, to be "restored" by __pendsv(), is put at the other end of
 * the stack, and thus reusable by the stack when not needed anymore.
 *
 * The initial context is an exception stack frame (ESF) since exiting the
 * PendSV exception will want to pop an ESF. Interestingly, even if the lsb of
 * an instruction address to jump to must always be set since the CPU always
 * runs in thumb mode, the ESF expects the real address of the instruction,
 * with the lsb *not* set (instructions are always aligned on 16 bit halfwords).
 * Since the compiler automatically sets the lsb of function addresses, we have
 * to unset it manually before storing it in the 'pc' field of the ESF.
 *
 * <options> is currently unused.
 *
 * @param pStackMem the aligned stack memory
 * @param stackSize stack size in bytes
