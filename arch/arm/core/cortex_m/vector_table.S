DESCRIPTION
Vector table in ROM for starting system. The reset vector is the system entry
point, ie. the first instruction executed.

The table is populated with all the system exception handlers. The NMI vector
must be populated with a valid handler since it can happen at any time. The
rest should not be triggered until the kernel is ready to handle them.
