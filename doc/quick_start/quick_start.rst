Quick Start Guide
#################

Use this guide to install the Zephyr development environment on your
development system and to build the |codename| on the supported platforms.

Currently, the |project| supports Linux development systems only. This guide
was tested by compiling and running the |codename|'s sample applications on
the following Linux distributions:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit
* Fedora 22 64 bit

Follow the steps appropriate for your development system's :abbr:`OS (Operating System)`.
Where needed, alternative instructions are listed for Ubuntu and Fedora.
Use these procedures to create a new development environment.
Given that the file hierarchy may change from one release to another,
these instructions might not work properly in an existing development environment.

Perform the steps in the installation procedures in the order they appear.
