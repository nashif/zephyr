Communication Tools
###################

Open source is about sharing development information. Maintainers
and contributors have the opportunity to communicate with each other
using open source collaboration tools: the mailing list, Gerrit and JIRA.
We strive to be open about our work with all key community stakeholders --
including maintainers and expert developers -- through the community mailing
list.

In this spirit, we prefer that contributors don't send private feedback
through email. Instead, please send feedback to the mailing list with
'Reply-to-all', and keeping the CC list intact. While the mailing list can
be used to hold design discussions, remember to submit all patches using
Gerrit.

The following sections contain information about the communication tools
used with the |project|.
