Communication Tools
###################

Open source is about sharing as much information as possible about the
development you are doing. Maintainers and contributors must
communicate and with each other using the open source collaboration
tools: the mailing list, Gerrit and JIRA. We strive to be open about
our work with all key community stakeholders -- including
maintainers and expert developers -- and the community mailing list.

In this spirit, do not send private feedback through email. Instead,
send feedback to the mailing list, making sure to hit 'Reply-to-all',
and keeping the CC list intact. While the mailing list can be used to
hold design discussions, remember to submit all patches using Gerrit.

The following sections contain information about the communication tools
used with the |project|.
