Laguage Usage Guidelines
########################

This section provides usage guidelines with regard to words,
punctuation, and grammar. The guidelines are not meant to replace a
review by a professional writer, but rather to help collaborators
submit consistent contributions.

Capitalization
**************
The preferred capitalization style for all documentation is sentence
case.

Words should only be capitalized when:

* They are proper nouns or adjectives.
* They refer to trademarked product names.
* They are part of a heading using title case.

.. important::
  Do not capitalize a word to indicate it has a greater status than
  other words. Never change the case of variable, function or file
  names; always keep the original case.

Capitalization styles
=====================

We refer to several capitalization styles in this document: uppercase,
title case, sentence case, and lowercase.

Do not use uppercase capitalization for any passages, not even extreme
warnings. Some legal disclaimers are written in all caps for emphasis;
this is the only exception.

The only paragraphs that shall use title case are the headings of the
document.

All items associated with tables and figures shall use sentence
case capitalization: Only the first word and proper names are
capitalized.

The following list provides sample paragraph types with the correct
capitalization style:


* Headings: Title case
   - Widget Pro User Manual
   - Installing Widget Pro in a Distributed Environment

* Table titles: Sentence case
   - MPEG profile/level matrix
* Table column headings: Sentence case
   - First level of values; Second level of values, etc.

* Figure titles, callouts and legends: Sentence case
   - Widget backplane connections
   - Edit icon
   - Date/time spinbox
   - Rate of acceleration
   - Color code explanation
   - Legend

Menu Capitalization
===================

When referring to software menu items by name, replicate the
capitalization as it appears in the software menus the user will see.
It is acceptable to refer to these items generically by using
lowercase letters if it is clear that your reference is generic and
not a specific name of a window or field on a menu, for example:

Click :guilabel:`Edit` to display the :guilabel:`Widget Configuration` window.

The widget configuration window has several advanced widget configuration options.

The second sentence could have capitalized the term "Widget
Configuration window"; but there are times when you might want to
refer to something with a generic descriptor and not its name. Observe
the use of the ReST markup ``:guilabel:`` on the first sentence.

A few other menu capitalization rules to keep in mind:

* Use "Select :menuselection:`File --> New`."

* Put the option to be selected last. "Select
  :menuselection:`View --> Side Bar --> Hide Side Bar`"

* Keep menu selection navigation to three steps or fewer. When
  more than three steps are needed, divide the steps using
  ``:guilabel:`` or ``:menuselection:``. For example: "Go to
  :guilabel:`File` and select
  :menuselection:`Print --> Print Preview --> Set Up`."

Software Version Capitalization
===============================
When referring to software or hardware versions, the letter v
should remain lower-case, and end with the version number. For example:

* Widget Pro v5.0
* Widget Master v2.1.12

Hyphenated or Slashed-concatenated Terms
========================================
For hyphenated or slash-concatenated terms, capitalize only the first
letter, even if they are headings. For example:

* Day/night Menu
* Follow-up Action Items

Plurals and Possessives
***********************
Because English plurals and possessives use the same /s/ and /z/
phonemes, they can create problems for even experienced writers. This
section discusses some of the common use cases.

Singular vs. Plural Possessives
===============================
Here are some guidelines for singular and plural possessives:

* Use only the apostrophe to show possession for a plural that ends in
  s: The boys' books.

* Use apostrophe + s to show possession for a plural that does not end
  in s: The men's books.

* Use apostrophe + s to show possession for a singular that ends in a
  silent sibilant: Illinois's capital.

* Use apostrophe + s to show possession for a singular that ends in a sibilant:
  s, x, c, z, or others.

The following table provides some examples with the correct and
incorrect cases and the notes that accompanies them.

+-------------------+------------------+---------------------------+
| Correct           | Incorrect        | Notes                     |

|                   |                  | office" not "the/BOSS/    |

| the box's lid     | the boxe's lid   | One could say "the box    |
|                   | the box' lid     | lid," avoiding the        |
|                   |                  | possessive.               |

|                   |                  | average," not "/LO-pez/   |
|                   |                  | average."                 |

|                   |                  | the apostrophe-s.         |
+-------------------+------------------+---------------------------+

Apostrophe-s Anomalies
======================

If a company name ends in s, x, c, or a sibilant sound, use the
apostrophe-s ending for possessives:

Traktronix's oscilloscopes

Exception: If the company name is intended as a plural, we allow the
apostrophe-only ending:

Tejada Instruments' calculators

In many cases, it is best to avoid the possessive form altogether for
singular possessives that already end in s, such as for company
names.  Use the company name as a nonpossessive modifier instead:

Traktronix oscilloscopes
Tejada Instruments calculators

We say "Intel equipment" when discussing Intel-branded products, not
"Intel's equipment", which implies that we own it, not that we produce
it. "Intel's equipment" sounds like the equipment that Intel employees
use.

Plural modifiers
================

Avoid plural modifiers. For example: system administrator, not a systems
administrator. It doesn't matter how many systems this person manages;
it's better to avoid using a plural of a word to modify a noun.

However, some exceptions do occur when the plural form is generally considered
singular: sales, physics, operations. Ask if you are unsure.

* operations manager
* sales department
* graphics team

Parenthetical plurals
=====================

Do not parenthesize optional plurals, whether added to the end of a
word, typically with the letter s, or internally. In general, think in
plurals when you write, assume that the user understands that a plural
could mean a singular as well. A typical user who has only one unit
will not be confused if you say "connect the units." On the contrary,
using parenthetical plurals often creates more confusion.

Correct

Men, women, children, college alumni, moose, and even desert plants
such as cacti should not use parentheses around plurals.

Incorrect

A m(e)n, wom(a)n, a child(ren), college alumn(i), (moose), and
even a desert plant(s) such as a cact(i) should not use a
parenthes(e)s around a plural(s).

Internal Plural Acronyms
========================

Some abbreviated terms can cause trouble, particularly when the
pluralized portion does not fall at the end of the phrase. These
internal-plural words should follow standard English pluralization
rules when abbreviated: The plural goes at the end of the term.

* Alarms acknowledged and logged: AAL, AALs.
* Attorneys-general: AG, AGs.
* Regions of interest: ROI, ROIs.

Plurals of Acronyms and Capitalized Product Names
=================================================

Pluralize acronyms, initialisms, and capitalized product names by
adding a lowercase s; do not use an apostrophe. If the term ends in a
sibilant (s, x, z, sometimes c and others), pluralize it by adding a
lowercase es. Examples:

Use TVs, DVDs, CDs, DVMRs not TV's, DVD's, CD's, DVMR's.
Use OSes not OSs, OS's.
Use TRAXes, iBOXes not TRAXs, TRAX's, iBOX's, iBOXs.
Use FAACes not FAAC's, assuming it is pronounced "face".
Use FAACs not FAAC's Assuming it is pronounced "fake".

When you hear the extra syllable in the plural, add the -es suffix
for the plural; if you do not hear the extra syllable, add the -s
suffix for the plural.



Latin plurals
=============

Pluralize Latin terms in body text as shown:

* Use appendixes not appendices.
* Use matrixes not matrices.
* Use indexes not indices.
* Use vertexes not vertices.

.. note::
  Some Latin plurals, such as parentheses, phenomena, alumni, and
  crises, are widely used and accepted in English.

Contractions
************
Use contractions wherever they seem appropriate, but consider how some
of them might be ambiguous and confusing to nonnative English-speaking
audiences.

Some contractions can cause confusion for nonnative English-speakers
because these contractions stand for more than one construction. For
example, there's can be a contraction of there is or there has. The
same applies to where's, it's, that's, and others.

Also avoid contractions of the word is, especially when combined with
company or product names. Say: "WidgetPro is an awesome product"; not
"WidgetPro's an awesome product".

Hyphenation
***********
A hyphen is often used to join words together to form a compound noun.
Compound nouns often go through this progressions:

* open compound: health care
* hyphenated compound: health-care
* closed compound: healthcare

The English language is trending away from hyphenated compounds to
closed compounds.

Prefix Hyphenation
==================

Do not hyphenate the prefixes listed below. Join the prefix to the
term being modified, even if this results in a double vowel or double
consonant:

ante, counter, intra, mini, pro, super, anti, extra, meta, non,
pseudo, trans, bi, by, infra, micro, post, re, ultra, bio, inter, mid,
pre, sub, un.

Here are some words that are often inappropriately hyphenated; do not
hyphenate these words either:

antitheft, multicamera, multiscreen, prepackaged, reuse, submenu,
autofocus, multifamily, multiuser, pseudoscience, semiannual, subtotal,
autoiris, multimedia, nonprofit, reengineered, semicircle, superuser,
microarchitecture, multiposition, predefined, reevaluate, subfolder,
superscript, microorganism, multiprotocol, predrilled, reinvent, submarine.

.. note::
  Question whether the pre- prefix is needed at all and consider
  leaving it off the word entirely if the meaning is the same.

Exceptions
----------

One overriding exception to the prefix rule is when the prefix is
prepended to a proper and capitalized noun:

* Non-European
* Mid-April (but: midweek)

Another exception is when the second word of a compound is a numeral:

* Pre-1914

Some prefixes, such as self-, half-, quasi-, and ex-, when meaning
"formerly", usually need a hyphen:

* Self-control, half-truth, quasi-corporation, ex-governor

Suffix Hyphenation
==================

In general, do not hyphenate suffixes. Here are some examples.

The suffix -wide is usually not hyphenated:

* Nationwide, worldwide, systemwide, campuswide, statewide,
  companywide, etc.

The suffix -wise is usually not hyphenated:

* Otherwise, businesswise, revenuewise, clockwise, counterclockwise

Commas, Semicolons, and Colons
******************************
Here are the most common problems encountered with commas, semicolons,
and colons. Please refer to **Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary**
when in doubt.

Serial Commas
=============

When writing a series or items, use the serial comma before coordinating
conjunctions to avoid confusion and ambiguity. For example:

* Mom, Dad, and I are going to the game.
* Mom, Dad and I are going to the game.

The first example uses the serial comma. It is clear in this sentence
that three people are going to the game. The second example does NOT
have a comma preceding the and. The reader may interpret this as
meaning the same thing as the first sentence, namely that three people
are going to the game, or that the speaker is addressing "Mom" and
telling her that only two people are going to the game.

Commas in Numbers
=================

Use commas to divide large numbers into sets of three digits. Use
periods for decimal points. Do not divide decimal digits into sets of
three.

Do not use a comma to separate four-digit bit/byte numbers.

Do not use a comma to separate four-digit page numbers.

Do not use a comma or other punctuation to separate decimals.


Semicolons ";"
==============
Here are some rules governing the use of semicolons:

* Use semicolons in long, sentence-style bulleted phrase lists.

* Use semicolons when two equal clauses are joined because of
  similarity of construction or meaning.

* Use semicolons in a series of items when at least one of the items
  itself includes a comma.

Examples of semicolon usage:

Similar construction: The prewidget comes before the widget; the
postwidget comes after it.

Comma-inclusive series: We traveled through Casper, Wyoming; Boise,
Idaho; and Eugene, Oregon.

Colons ":"
==========

If the text following a colon is a sentence, capitalize the
first word after the colon. If the subsequent text is not a sentence,
do not capitalize the first term unless it is a title. For example:

* This is a capitalization example: Donuts do not cause holes.

* These is a noncapitalization example: colons, semicolons, and commas.

* In a title, use title case following the colon. Example: Tires: How
  to Fix a Flat.

* Use a colon at the end of a sentence or phrase that introduces
  examples, a list, a path, user input, or code.

* Don't use a colon to introduce graphics, tables, or sections.

* Don't use a colon at the end of a task title or any heading.


Quotation marks
***************
Follow these guidelines for quotation marks:

* Restrict use of quotation marks to terms as terms.
* Do not use quotation marks for emphasis; use *italics* for emphasis.
* Avoid using single-quote marks.
* Commas and periods typically go inside the end-quote; semicolons, colons,
  question marks, and exclamation points typically go outside quotation marks
  unless they are part of the actual quotation.
