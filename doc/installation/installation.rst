Installation Guide
##################

The installation guide includes all the information you need
to install the Zephyr development environment on your host system.
Follow the steps appropriate for your host system's operating system.

Currently, the |project| supports Linux host systems only. The installation
guide was tested by compiling and running Zephyr sample applications on the
following Linux distributions:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit
* Fedora 22 64 bit

Only use these procedures to create a new |project| development
environment. Do not use them to update an existing environment. They do
not account for file hierarchy changes that may occur from release to
release.

Perform the steps in the installation procedures in the order they
appear.
