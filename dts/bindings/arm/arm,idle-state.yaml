compatible: "arm,idle-state"

properties:
  local-timer-stop:
    required: false
    description:
      If present the CPU local timer control logic is
         lost on state entry, otherwise it is retained.
    type: boolean

  entry-latency-us:
    type: int
    required: true
    description:
      Worst case latency in microseconds required to enter the idle state.

  exit-latency-us:
    type: int
    required: true
    description:
      Worst case latency in microseconds required to exit the idle state.
      The exit-latency-us duration may be guaranteed only after
      entry-latency-us has passed.

  min-residency-us:
    type: int
    required: true
    description:
      Minimum residency duration in microseconds, inclusive of preparation
      and entry, for this idle state to be considered worthwhile energy wise
      (refer to section 2 of this document for a complete description).

  wakeup-latency-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: |
      Maximum delay between the signaling of a wake-up event and the CPU
      being able to execute normal code again. If omitted, this is assumed
      to be equal to:

        entry-latency-us + exit-latency-us

      It is important to supply this value on systems where the duration of
      PREP phase (see diagram 1, section 2) is non-neglibigle. In such
      systems entry-latency-us + exit-latency-us will exceed
      wakeup-latency-us by this duration.
