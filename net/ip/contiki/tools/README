tunslip6
========

tunslip6 can be used in host side to create a tun device that
is connected to a unix socket that qemu is providing. This
way it is possible to pass packets between host and target
system via slip protocol.

You need to connect tunslip6 to the second qemu serial line
through a UNIX socket (qemu option -serial unix:/tmp/slip-socket).

1) Start socat

$ socat PTY,link=/tmp/slip.dev UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/slip.sock

2) Start qemu, use the listener demo app. Note that you need to
   set CONFIG_NETWORKING_UART=y in your configuration.

   You might need to set the BSP and ARCH like this if simple_uart
   driver is not found in your default BSP.

$ make BSP=ti_lm3s6965 ARCH=arm \
     QEMU_EXTRA_FLAGS="-serial none -serial unix:/tmp/slip.sock" qemu

3) Start tunslip6

$ sudo ./tunslip6 -s `readlink /tmp/slip.dev` aaaa::1/64

4) Send data to listener

$ nc -u -6 aaaa::2 4242 <<EOF
foobar
EOF
