if CONSOLE

config CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	bool
	default n
	help
	This is an option to be enabled by console drivers to signal
	that some kind of console exists.

config CONSOLE_HANDLER
	bool
	prompt "Enable console input handler"
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN
	default n
	help
	This option enables console input handler allowing to write simple
	interaction between serial console and the OS.

config UART_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Use UART for console"
	default n
	depends on SERIAL && SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	Enable this option to use one UART for console. Make sure
	CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE_INDEX is also set correctly.

config UART_CONSOLE_INDEX
	int "UART Console Index"
	default 0
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	This option specifies index for the console uart port.

config UART_CONSOLE_BAUDRATE
	int "UART Console Baud Rate"
	default 115200
	depends on UART_CONSOLE
	help
	This specifies the baud rate for the UART console.

	Default is 115200, which should be usable for most RS232
	and USB adapters.

config RAM_CONSOLE
	bool
	prompt "Use RAM console"
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	Emit console messages to a RAM buffer "ram_console" which can
	be examined at runtime with a debugger. Useful in board bring-up
	if there aren't any working serial drivers.

config RAM_CONSOLE_BUFFER_SIZE
	int "Ram Console buffer size"
	default 1024
	depends on RAM_CONSOLE
	help
	Size of the RAM console buffer. Messages will wrap around if the
	length is exceeded.

config IPI_CONSOLE_SENDER
	bool
	prompt "Inter-processor Interrupt console sender"
	default n
	help
	Enable the sending side of IPI console

config IPI_CONSOLE_RECEIVER
	bool
	prompt "Inter-processor interrupt console receiver"
	select RING_BUFFER
	default n
