        Allows the I2C port to be brought up with a default configuration.
        This is useful to set if other drivers depend upon using the I2C bus
        before the application has a chance to custom configure the port.
        Setting this value does not prohibit the application from customizing
        the values later.  Refer to the I2C datasheet for proper values.
