menuconfig PINMUX
        bool "Enable platform pinmux driver"
        default n

config PINMUX_BASE
        hex "Base Address"
	depends on PINMUX
        help
        On platforms where there is a base pinmux register, set this value to
        enable the driver to directly access the memory.

config PINMUX_NUM_PINS
	int "Number of Pins to configure"
	depends on PINMUX
        help
        Select the number of pins for the pinmux to operate on.

config PINMUX_DEV
        bool "Configure pinmux for early board testing"
        depends on PINMUX
        default n
        help
        Enables the use of the pinmux_set and pinmux_get functions for early
        prototyping on new hardware.  WARNING: When using these options, it
        is possible to permanently damage the hardware.
