config SHARED_IRQ
	bool
	prompt "Shared interrupt driver"
	default n
	help
	 Include shared interrupt support in system. Shared interrupt
	 support is NOT required in most systems. If in doubt answer no.

config SHARED_IRQ_NUM_CLIENTS
	int
	depends on SHARED_IRQ
	prompt "The number of clients per instance"
	default 5
	help
	 Configures the maximum nuber of clients allowed per shared
	 instance of the shared interrupt driver. To conserve RAM set
	 this value to the lowest practical value.

config SHARED_IRQ_0
	bool "Shared interrupt instance 0"
	depends on SHARED_IRQ
	help
	 Provide an instance of the shared interrupt driver when system
	 configuration requires that multiple devices share an interrupt.

	depends on SHARED_IRQ_0
	default "SHARED_IRQ0"

	int "instance 0 interrupt priority"
	default 0
	depends on SHARED_IRQ_0
	help
	 Prioity of shared interrupt handler for the configured interrupt

	bool "Falling Edge"
	help
	  Interrupt triggers on falling edge.

config SHARED_IRQ_0_RISING_EDGE
	bool "Rising Edge"
	help
	  Interrupt triggers on rising edge.

config SHARED_IRQ_0_LEVEL_HIGH
	bool "Level High"
	help
	  Interrupt triggers when level is high.

config SHARED_IRQ_0_LEVEL_LOW
	bool "Level Low"
