config SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	bool
	default n
	help
	This is an option to be enabled by individual serial driver
	to signal that there is a serial driver. This is being used
	by other drivers which are dependent on serial.

config SERIAL_INTERRUPT_LEVEL
	bool "Serial interrupt level"
	depends on IOAPIC
	default y
	help
	Option signifies that the serial controller uses level interrupts
	instead of edge

config SERIAL_INTERRUPT_LOW
	bool "Serial interrupt low"
	depends on IOAPIC
	default n
	help
	Option signifies that the serial controller uses low level interrupts
	instead of high

config NS16550
	bool "NS16550 serial driver"
	default n
	select SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	This option enables the NS16550 serial driver.
	This driver can be used for the serial hardware
	available on x86 platforms such as basic_atom and
	basic_minuteia.
