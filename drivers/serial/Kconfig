config SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	bool
	default n
	help
	This is an option to be enabled by individual serial driver
	to signal that there is a serial driver. This is being used
	by other drivers which are dependent on serial.

menu "Serial Port Options"
depends on X86_32

config SERIAL_INTERRUPT_LEVEL
	bool "Serial interrupt level"
	depends on IOAPIC
	default y
	help
	Option signifies that the serial controller uses level interrupts
	instead of edge

config SERIAL_INTERRUPT_LOW
	bool "Serial interrupt low"
	depends on IOAPIC
	default n
	help
	Option signifies that the serial controller uses low level interrupts
	instead of high

config NS16550
	bool "NS16550 serial driver"
	default n
	select SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	This option enables the NS16550 serial driver.
	This specific driver can be used for the serial hardware
	available at the Generic PC and Quark.

config NS16550_PCI
	bool "NS16550 PCI serial driver"
	default n
	depends on PCI && NS16550
	help
	This enables NS16550 to probe for PCI-based serial devices.

	This option enables the driver to auto-detect the device
	configuration required to access those ports.

config NS16550_PCI_NUM_PORTS
	int "Number of PCI serial ports"
	default 2
	depends on NS16550_PCI
	help
	This indicates the number of PCI-based serial ports to probe.

config K20_UART
	bool "K20 serial driver"
	default n
	select SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	This option enables the K20 serial driver.
	This specific driver can be used for the serial hardware
	available at the Freescale FRDM K64F platform.

config STELLARIS_UART
	bool "Stellaris serial driver"
	default n
	select SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER
	help
	This option enables the Stellaris serial driver.
	This specific driver can be used for the serial hardware
	available at the Texas Instrument LM3S6965 platform.
