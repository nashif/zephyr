menu "Interrupt Controllers"

config LOAPIC
	bool "LOAPIC"
	default n
	select IOAPIC
	depends on X86_32
	help
	This option selects local APIC as the interrupt controller.

config LOAPIC_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "Local APIC Base Address"
	default 0xFEE00000
	depends on LOAPIC
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the Local APIC device.

config IOAPIC
	bool "IOAPIC"
	default y
	depends on LOAPIC
	help
	This option signifies that the target has an IO-APIC device. This
	capability allows IO-APIC-dependent code to be included.

config IOAPIC_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "IO-APIC Base Address"
	default 0xFEC00000
	depends on IOAPIC
	help
	This option specifies the base address of the IO-APIC device.

config IOAPIC_NUM_RTES
	int "Number of Redirection Table Entries available"
	default 24
	depends on IOAPIC
	help
	This option indicates the maximum number of Redirection Table Entries
	(RTEs) (one per IRQ available to the IO-APIC) made available to the
	kernel, regardless of the number provided by the hardware itself. For
	most efficient usage of memory, it should match the number of IRQ lines
	needed by devices connected to the IO-APIC.

config ARCV2_INTERRUPT_UNIT
	bool "ARCv2 Interrupt Unit"
	default y
	depends on ARC
	help
	The ARCv2 interrupt unit has 16 allocated exceptions associated with
	vectors 0 to 15 and 240 interrupts associated with vectors 16 to 255.
	The interrupt unit is optional in the ARCv2-based processors. When
	building a processor, you can configure the processor to include an
	interrupt unit. The ARCv2 interrupt unit is highly programmable.
