config QMI_DRIVERS
	depends on X86_32
	bool "Enable QMI drivers [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	default n
	help
	This option enables QMI device drivers. These drivers are actually shim
	drivers based on drivers provided by QMI BSP. The BSP provides a static
	library (libqmi) which implements several drivers for peripherals from
	Intel MCUs (e.g. Quark SE and Quark D2000). If unsure, say N.

config LIBQMI_PATH
	depends on QMI_DRIVERS
	string "Path to libqmi"
	help
	Set path to libqmi.
