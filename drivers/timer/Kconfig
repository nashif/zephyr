config HPET_TIMER
	bool "HPET timer"
	default n
	depends on IOAPIC && X86_32
	help
	This option selects High Precision Event Timer (HPET) as a
	system timer.

config HPET_TIMER_LEGACY_EMULATION
	bool "HPET timer legacy emulation mode"
	default n
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This option switches HPET to legacy emulation mode.
	In this mode 8254 PIT is disabled, HPET timer0 is connected
	to IOAPIC IRQ2, timer1 -- to IOAPIC IRQ8.

config HPET_TIMER_DEBUG
	bool "Enable HPET debug output"
	default n
	depends on HPET_TIMER && PRINTK
	help
	This option enables HPET debugging output.

config LOAPIC_TIMER
	bool "LOAPIC timer"
	depends on LOAPIC && X86_32
	default n
	help
	This option selects LOAPIC timer as a system timer.

config PIT
	bool "PIT (i8253)"
	default n
	depends on PIC && X86_32
	help
	This option selects legacy i8253 timer as system timer.

config ARCV2_TIMER
	bool "ARC Timer"
	default y
	depends on ARC
	help
	This module implements a kernel device driver for the ARCv2 processor timer 0
	and provides the standard "system clock driver" interfaces.

config CORTEX_M_TIMER
	bool "Cortex-M Timer"
	default y
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M
	help
	This module implements a kernel device driver for the Cortex-M processor
	systick timer and provides the standard "system clock driver" interfaces.
