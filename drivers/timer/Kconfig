config HPET_TIMER
	bool "HPET timer"
	default n
	depends on X86_32
        select IOAPIC
        select LOAPIC
	help
	This option selects High Precision Event Timer (HPET) as a
	system timer.

config HPET_TIMER_LEGACY_EMULATION
	bool "HPET timer legacy emulation mode"
	default n
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This option switches HPET to legacy emulation mode.
	In this mode 8254 PIT is disabled, HPET timer0 is connected
	to IOAPIC IRQ2, timer1 -- to IOAPIC IRQ8.

config HPET_TIMER_DEBUG
	bool "Enable HPET debug output"
	default n
	depends on HPET_TIMER && PRINTK
	help
	This option enables HPET debugging output.

config HPET_TIMER_BASE_ADDRESS
	hex "HPET Base Address"
	default 0xFED00000
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This options specifies the base address of the HPET timer device.

config HPET_TIMER_IRQ
	int "HPET Timer IRQ"
	default 20
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This option specifies the IRQ used by the HPET timer.

config HPET_TIMER_IRQ_PRIORITY
	int "HPET Timer IRQ Priority"
	default 4
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This option specifies the IRQ priority used by the HPET timer.

prompt "HPET Interrupt Trigger Condition"
default HPET_TIMER_FALLING_EDGE

config HPET_TIMER_FALLING_EDGE
	bool "Falling Edge"
	help
	This option signifies that the HPET timer uses falling edge interrupts.

config HPET_TIMER_RISING_EDGE
	bool "Rising Edge"
	help
	This option signifies that the HPET timer uses rising edge interrupts.

config HPET_TIMER_LEVEL_HIGH
	bool "Level High"
	help
	This option signifies that the HPET timer uses level high interrupts.

config HPET_TIMER_LEVEL_LOW
	bool "Level Low"
	help
	This option signifies that the HPET timer uses level low interrupts.

config LOAPIC_TIMER
	bool "LOAPIC timer"
	depends on (LOAPIC || MVIC) && X86_32
	default n
	help
	This option selects LOAPIC timer as a system timer.

config LOAPIC_TIMER_IRQ
	int "Local APIC Timer IRQ"
	default 24
	depends on LOAPIC_TIMER
	help
	This option specifies the IRQ used by the LOAPIC timer.

config LOAPIC_TIMER_IRQ_PRIORITY
	int "Local APIC Timer IRQ Priority"
	default 2
	depends on LOAPIC_TIMER
	help
	This options specifies the IRQ priority used by the LOAPIC timer.

config LOAPIC_TIMER_DIVIDER_UNSUPPORTED
	bool "LOAPIC timer divider unsupported"
	depends on LOAPIC_TIMER  && MVIC && X86_32
	default n
	help
	This option selects if Local Apic Timer divider register is supported.

	The MVIC interrupt controller does not provide the Timer Divide
	Configuration Register (TDC).

config ARCV2_TIMER
	bool "ARC Timer"
	default y
	depends on ARC
	help
	This module implements a kernel device driver for the ARCv2 processor timer 0
	and provides the standard "system clock driver" interfaces.

config CORTEX_M_SYSTICK
	bool "Cortex-M SYSTICK timer"
	default y
	depends on CPU_CORTEX_M
	help
	This module implements a kernel device driver for the Cortex-M processor
	SYSTICK timer and provides the standard "system clock driver" interfaces.

config SYSTEM_CLOCK_DISABLE
	bool "API to disable system clock"
	default n
	help
	This option enables the sys_clock_disable() API in the kernel. It is
	needed by some subsystems (which will automatically select it), but is
	rarely needed by applications.
