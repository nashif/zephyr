	hex "HPET Base Address"
	default 0xFED00000
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This options specifies the base address of the HPET timer device.

config HPET_TIMER_IRQ
	int "HPET Timer IRQ"
	default 20
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This option specifies the IRQ used by the HPET timer.

config HPET_TIMER_IRQ_PRIORITY
	int "HPET Timer IRQ Priority"
	default 4
	depends on HPET_TIMER
	help
	This option specifies the IRQ priority used by the HPET timer.

	bool "Falling Edge"
	help
	This option signifies that the HPET timer uses falling edge interrupts.

config HPET_TIMER_RISING_EDGE
	bool "Rising Edge"
	help
	This option signifies that the HPET timer uses rising edge interrupts.

config HPET_TIMER_LEVEL_HIGH
	bool "Level High"
	help
	This option signifies that the HPET timer uses level high interrupts.

config HPET_TIMER_LEVEL_LOW
	bool "Level Low"
