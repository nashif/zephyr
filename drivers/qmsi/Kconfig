config QMSI_DRIVERS
	depends on X86
	bool "Enable QMSI drivers [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	select CONSOLE_HAS_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	This option enables QMSI device drivers. These drivers are actually shim
	drivers based on drivers provided by QMSI BSP. The BSP provides a static
	library (libqmsi) which implements several drivers for peripherals from
	Intel MCUs (e.g. Quark SE and Quark D2000). If unsure, say N.

config LIBQMSI_PATH
	depends on QMSI_DRIVERS
	string "Path to libqmsi"
	help
	Set path to libqmsi library and header directory.
